The **significantEarthquakes** package was developed for the capstone
course of the “Mastering Software Development in R Specialization” by
Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

Earthquake data originates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration’s earthquakes database: National Geophysical Data Center
/ World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): NCEI/WDS Global Significant Earthquake
Database. NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.
<doi:10.7289/V5TD9V7K>

Downloading data from the database results in a *.tsv* file.
